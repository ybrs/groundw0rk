groundw0rk
-----------------------
groundw0rk is a timeseries database and server built spesifically for monitoring jobs.

groundw0rk is built on top of pandas/numpy and asyncio/sonic.

PS: don't try to use this in production, its mostly for learning purposes for now.

Why another monitoring/timeseries database ?
--------------------------------------------
just for fun maybe.

What's different than others ?
--------------------------------------------
- multi-tenant
- stores data in flat csv files on top of ZFS. doesn't try to be smart.
- more to come.
